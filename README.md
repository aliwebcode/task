**Full-stack Web Development Recruitment Test**

**Auth**
Laravel Sanctum

**Technical Points**
1- Validation:
I used very simple validation methods (because of time) we can develop the validation system by divide Requests in Single Files and organize error messages.
2- Response Messages:
We can develop system by using notification library like (sweetalert).
3- Models:
I used Model Relations and functions to handle backend process like:
A. Get Closest Discount.
B. Get Current SubCategory Level to Prevent user from exceed the limit.
C. Define Limit in Category Model.
D. Add final_discount to Models as Attribute to receive it on frontend.

NOTES:
About (bundle analyzer) I haven't used it before, but I can learn it in a short time ^_^
